The data was downloaded from the website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gargmanas/sentimental-analysis-for-tweets

The dataset contains tweets on the basis of which it has been determined whether the author of the post is depressed or not. 
I will conduct a sentiment analysis that will determine, based on the emotions hidden behind the tweets, whether a particular tweet is written by 
a person with depression (labeled as 1 in the decision class) or whether the person does not have depression (labeled as 0 in the decision class). 
The dataset contains 10,314 tweets.
